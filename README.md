# Stockholm-ticket-art
Stockholm ticket art competition

This is a personal art-project for Stockholm Ticket Art. It is an inofficial, rolling contest by some interested in ticket-art in the Stockholm area.

The purpose is art, and nothing else. This entry is a submission of one individuals (with the unknowing help of others and their skill) artistic intepretation of the Stockholm SL tickets. 
Remember that it is a serious crime in Sweden to use fake-tickets.
