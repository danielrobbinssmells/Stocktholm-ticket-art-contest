# Stocktholm-ticket-art-contest
Stockholm ticket art competition

This is a personal art-project for Stockholm Ticket Art. It is an inofficial contest known only to some interested in Ticket-art in Stockholm, Sweden.

The purpose is art, and nothing else. This entry is a submission of one individual (with the unknowing help of others and their skill) artistic intepretation of the Stockholm SL tickets. 

Have a good day.
