# Stockholm-ticket-art
Stockholm ticket art competition

This is a personal art-project for Stockholm Ticket Art. It is an inofficial, rolling contest by some interested in ticket-art in the Stockholm area.

The purpose is art, and nothing else. This entry is a submission of one individuals (with the unknowing help of others and their skill) artistic intepretation of the Stockholm SL tickets. 
Remember that it is a serious crime in Sweden to use fake-tickets. 

# In order to view on mobile, Android device: 

Get the .zip file on to your Android phone, either surf to this page, view as desktop version and download directly or 
download the .zip to your computer and send to your Android phone.
I use wifi via kdeconnect, but some email it to themselves and download it from there (to their phone). 

Next open the Android file manager, navigate to the downloaded .zip file and extract it.

Next start your Firefox browser and search for '/' in the search bar. 
It is important that you type only /  that is, the forward slash-symbol and hit search. Firefox will show you your own directory tree.

You must now navigate through the folders: sdcard/Download/stockholm-ticket-art-master and in the unzipped directory you will find a file called index.html which you may now click.

You may now enjoy your ticket-art.

# Do not use as fake-ticket in Sweden as it is very illegal and would constitute forgery!
